# Custom Drawer System Specification

## Project Summary

**Objective**: Design and build a custom drawer system for F-250 bed optimized for weight, accessibility, and Super Pacific wedge integration.

**Decision**: Research half-width options vs proven DECKED + Super Pacific integration.

**Key Requirements**:
- F-250 6.75' bed + Super Pacific compatibility (critical)
- Reversible installation (bolt-in, no bed drilling)  
- Weather-resistant storage for PNW conditions
- Weight discipline (≤180 lbs preferred)
- Proven reliability over custom complexity

**Approach Options**:
1. **DECKED D4** - Simple, proven, F-250 specific (210 lbs, $1,400-1,600)
2. **Half-width custom** - Preserve walking space but requires research/design
- **Estimated Cost**: $1,400-2,000 depending on approach
- **Target Weight**: 150-210 lbs depending on solution
- **Lead Time**: 2-6 weeks (DECKED vs custom fabrication)

**Implementation Timeline**: Phase 2 (post suspension install, before major electrical)

### Top Candidate Analysis

#### DECKED D4 + Super Pacific (Pragmatic Choice)
**Strengths**:
- **Confirmed F-250 6.75' bed engineering** - no guesswork on fit
- Proven reliability and extensive user base
- Strong dealer network and parts availability  
- Professional installation available
- Weather sealing adequate for most conditions

**Critical Unknown**: 
- **Super Pacific + DECKED integration** needs verification
- Height clearance when camper deployed vs DECKED deck height
- Access ergonomics - how does it feel to use both systems together?
- Fridge mounting on DECKED deck with camper above

**Decision Gate**: 
- Test fit Super Pacific + DECKED interaction before final commitment
- May require Super Pacific dealer consultation on clearances
- Consider visiting DECKED dealer with Super Pacific dimensions

#### Local PNW Fabrication (Custom Route)
**Strengths**:
- **Perfect integration** designed around Super Pacific + F-250 specifics
- Half-width preserves walking space and truck utility
- Lightest weight option (100-130 lbs vs 210 lbs)
- Support local craftsmanship

**Challenges**:
- Research and design time investment
- Need to find qualified fabricator with truck storage experience
- Potential for delays or design iterations
- Less proven than commercial solutions

#### Custom Local Fabrication (Best Value)
**Strengths**:
- **Perfect F-250 6.75' bed + Super Pacific integration**
- Lightest option (100-130 lbs)
- Complete customization of layout and features
- Support local PNW fabrication

**Approach**:
- Half-width cabinet on one side (driver or passenger)
- Integrated fridge slide and power routing
- Marine-grade materials for PNW conditions
- Bolt-to-L-track mounting (reversible)

**Considerations**:
- Requires finding qualified local fabricator
- Design and build timeline (4-6 weeks)
- Need detailed specifications upfront

## Implementation Planning

### Phase 2 Procurement Plan
1. **Research Phase** (1-2 weeks)
   - **Priority A**: Contact DECKED dealer about Super Pacific + D4 integration clearances
   - **Priority B**: Find local PNW fabricators with truck storage experience  
   - **Secondary**: Research other F-250 specific systems if DECKED integration problematic
   - Document Super Pacific deployment dimensions and clearance needs
   - Get quotes from DECKED dealer and 1-2 local fabrication options for comparison

2. **Decision Phase** (1 week)
   - Weight vs features final evaluation
   - Budget confirmation ($1,500-2,000 range)
   - Installation scheduling (DIY vs professional)

3. **Installation Phase** (1-2 days)
   - Remove Super Pacific temporarily if needed
   - System install and integration
   - Power routing for fridge/accessories
   - Load testing and adjustment

### Power Integration Requirements
- **Fridge Circuit**: 10 AWG from aux battery, 40A fuse, Anderson connector
- **Accessory Power**: 14 AWG for lights/USB, switched distribution
- **Routing**: Through drawer system or alongside, weatherproof connections

### Success Criteria
- ≤180 lb total weight impact
- Weather-tight storage achieved  
- Fridge mounting secure for off-road use
- Complete drawer access maintained
- No bed damage/permanent modification

## Fridge & Power Integration Stubs

| Component           | Stub Provision                              | Notes               |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------|

| Constant load < 400 lb after 3 trips      | Maintain bins longer |

## Research Action Items

### Immediate Steps (Next 2 Weeks)
1. **Local Fabricator Research**:
   - Search Seattle/Tacoma/Portland metal fabrication shops
   - Look for marine fabricators (experienced with weather sealing)
   - Check truck equipment installers who do custom storage
   - Get referrals from local 4WD/overland communities

2. **F-250 Specific System Research**:
   - Contact Drawer Tech directly about F-250 6.75' options
   - Check if Front Runner Wolf Pack actually fits F-250 dimensions
   - Research smaller companies that specialize in Super Duty storage
   - Look for F-250 build threads on forums (what storage did they use?)

3. **Design Requirements Documentation**:
   - Sketch half-width layout preferences (driver vs passenger side)
   - List specific storage needs (tool sizes, fridge integration, etc.)
   - Document Super Pacific clearance requirements
   - Define preferred materials (aluminum vs marine plywood)

---
Assumptions: Future fridge ~50 lb empty; constant water load < 80 lb; adjust targets if actual constant load > goal by >15%.
