# Storage & Organization Gate Outline

Objective: Transition from ad-hoc bins to a semi-permanent drawer / panel system only when data shows recurring efficiency or safety gains, while preserving payload buffer and keeping CG forward and low.

## Current Philosophy Snapshot

- Present Mode: Modular bins + molle panels (planned) inside Super Pacific wedge.
- Emphasis: Fast setup/teardown, clear organization (owner priority), minimal early weight.

## Gate Triggers (Advance When ≥2 Met)

| Trigger Domain    | Metric / Observation                          | Threshold                  | Measurement Method   | Notes                                    |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Retrieval Time    | Avg time to locate common item (top 10 items) | >45 sec avg                | Time 3 trips; log    | Indicates search inefficiency            |
| Lost Item Events  | Times an item was re-purchased / forgotten    | ≥2 / quarter               | Trip debrief         | Organization failure cost                |
| Bed Repack Time   | Camp departure to stowed                      | >20 min consistently       | Stopwatch            | Setup fatigue driver                     |
| Payload Growth    | Constant rear load (ex water, tools)          | >600 lb constant           | Weight ledger        | Drawer weight becomes smaller % overhead |
| Safety            | Unrestrained mass shifts under braking        | Any slide >6" or tip event | Observation / photos | Secure containment priority              |

## Drawer System Design Targets (When Gate Opens)

| Aspect          | Target                                                            | Rationale                              |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Weight (empty)  | ≤ 140 lb (full system 2 drawers + top deck)                       | Maintain payload buffer                |
| Material        | Hybrid: 12mm marine ply carcass + aluminum slides                 | Balance cost & serviceability          |
| Fastening       | Bolted to bed L-track / factory tie-downs (no drilling bed floor) | Reversible                             |
| Modularity      | Removable in ≤60 min with 2 people                                | Preserve truck utility                 |
| Height          | Maintain lowest deck ≤ drawer internal 9"                         | Preserve vertical space for bins above |
| Tie-Down Points | At least 4 recessed rings on deck                                 | Secure bins / fridge                   |
| Venting         | Passive slots for damp items drawer                               | PNW moisture mitigation                |

## Panel / Vertical Storage

| Panel Type              | Location        | Primary Items                       | Notes                             |
|-------------------------|-----------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Molle Panel (Driver)    | Canopy side     | Shovel, axe, recovery soft goods    | Quick access; weight mid height   |
| Molle Panel (Passenger) | Canopy side     | First aid, small tools              | Keep med kit visible, not blocked |
| Rear Door Panel         | Inside tailgate | Small fast-grab (gloves, headlamps) | Night operations                  |

## Weight Accounting Template

| Category | Subcat   | Item                  | Qty   | Unit Wt (lb) | Total (lb) | Location    | Notes               |
|----------|----------|-----------------------|-------|--------------|-----------:|-------------|---------------------|
| Storage  | Drawer   | Carcass + deck        | 1     | 120          |        120 | Bed lower   | Verified scale TBD  |
| Storage  | Panel    | Driver molle panel    | 1     | 9            |          9 | Side high   | Aluminum            |
| Storage  | Panel    | Passenger molle panel | 1     | 9            |          9 | Side high   | Aluminum            |
| Storage  | Hardware | Tie-down / L-track    | 1 set | 6            |          6 | Distributed | Stainless fasteners |

Track delta vs original bin solution (estimate current bin system weight ≈ 40 lb).

## Decision Matrix (Build vs Buy)

| Option                         |          Cost | Est Weight | Custom Fit |     Lead Time | Serviceability | Notes                            |
|--------------------------------|--------------:|-----------:|-----------:|--------------:|---------------:|----------------------------------|
| Commercial Drawer (ARB/DECKED) | $1,500–$1,900 | 210–230 lb |          2 |       2–4 wks |              3 | High weight penalty              |
| Custom Plywood Hybrid          |     $600–$800 | 120–140 lb |          5 | 1–2 wks (DIY) |              5 | Optimal weight/fit               |
| Aluminum Fabricated            | $1,800–$2,400 | 110–130 lb |          5 |       3–5 wks |              4 | Higher cost; corrosion resistant |

Score custom hybrid highest for weight discipline + budget.

## Fridge & Power Integration Stubs

| Component           | Stub Provision                              | Notes               |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| Fridge (future)     | 8 AWG fused feed + Anderson at drawer front | Avoid re-run later  |
| Starlink            | 14 AWG duplex to roof pass-through          | Label SLK           |
| GMRS Radio          | 16 AWG switched feed near cab bulkhead      | Inline fuse         |
| Lighting (interior) | 16 AWG loop in upper channel                | Daisy chain anchors |

## Ergonomics & Access

- Tailgate Work Surface: Consider HDPE or bamboo insert; adds ~6 lb; optional until damage observed.
- Drawer Segmentation: Removable half-height dividers; weight negligible (~2 lb total) vs fixed partitions.
- Labeling: Heat-shrink printed labels on handle edge for night ID.

## Moisture & Corrosion Prevention

| Risk                    | Mitigation                                | Notes              |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------|--------------------|
| Plywood edge wicking    | Epoxy seal all raw cuts; polyurethane top | Extend life        |
| Condensation under deck | Two 1" passive vents front corners        | Air turnover       |
| Hardware corrosion      | 304/316 stainless + anti-seize            | Disassembly future |

## Pre-Build Validation Checklist

| Item                                 | Status  | Notes                     |
|--------------------------------------|---------|---------------------------|
| Weight ledger updated (current bins) | Pending | Weigh empty bins set      |
| Retrieval time log (3 trips)         | Pending | Create small log sheet    |
| Lost item events count               | Pending | Start now                 |
| Rattle/noise assessment              | Pending | Drive corrugation segment |

## Post-Install Metrics (30-Day Review)

| Metric               | Target          | Action if Missed                       |
|----------------------|-----------------|----------------------------------------|
| Added weight vs plan | ≤ +10%          | Drill lightening holes / swap hardware |
| Retrieval time avg   | <25 sec         | Adjust dividers / labeling             |
| Rattle level         | Subjective ≤2/5 | Add foam isolation                     |

## Gate Close Criteria (Abort / Delay)

| Condition                                 | Action               |
|-------------------------------------------|----------------------|
| Payload buffer shrinks < 800 lb remaining | Delay drawer install |
| Constant load < 400 lb after 3 trips      | Maintain bins longer |

## Immediate Next Steps

1. Begin logging retrieval time & lost item events next 2 outings.
2. Weigh existing bin system & contents; enter ledger.
3. Sketch custom layout with fridge placeholder footprint (even if fridge TBD).
4. Decide wiring stubs to pre-run before drawer carcass installed.

---
Assumptions: Future fridge ~50 lb empty; constant water load < 80 lb; adjust targets if actual constant load > goal by >15%.
