# Recovery Kit BOM (Phase-Structured)

## Project Summary

| Aspect                | Details                                                       |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Total Cost Est**    | **$615 Phase 1** → $1,015 Phase 2 → $1,415+ Phase 3 (winch)   |
| **Added Weight**      | **~39 lbs Phase 1** (rear-biased storage)                     |
| **Install Time**      | **4-6 hours** (mount points + organization + initial testing) |
| **Build Phase**       | **Phase 1 (Foundation)** - Core safety capability             |
| **Dependencies**      | None - baseline safety requirement                            |
| **Skill Level**       | **Beginner** (basic mounting, no electrical work)             |
| **Professional Work** | **None required** - all bolt-on or soft mounting              |
| **Commissioning**     | **First recovery event** to validate gear and technique       |

### Phasing Rationale
**Install Immediately (Phase 1)** because:
- Essential safety capability - should never enter trails without recovery gear
- No technical dependencies - can install and use immediately  
- Weight discipline enforced - only core essentials first
- Expandable system - validated gear choices inform Phase 2 additions
- Confidence building - enables more challenging trail selection

### Key Decisions Made
- ✅ **ARB TRED Pro** traction boards (cold weather performance)
- ✅ **Yankum 7/8"** kinetic rope (regional PNW company, proven quality)
- ✅ **2.5" direct-fit** shackle block (eliminates reducer slop)
- ✅ **Synthetic over steel** for weight discipline and safety

---

Vehicle Context: 2025 F-250 Tremor (7.3 gas) ~7500–7800 lb curb (assumed), GVWR ~10,800 lb. Tremor has factory front tow hooks (confirm stamped WLL). Rear: 2.5" hitch receiver with 2" reducer sleeve on hand; prefer direct 2.5" recovery hardware to eliminate slop and maximize pin shear margin.

Principles:
- Weight discipline: choose synthetic, modular, multi-use components.
- Ratings: Minimum WLL ~1.5× GVW static for rigging hardware; Kinetic rope MBS 2.5–3× vehicle weight.
- Sequencing: Buy only what unlocks safe self-recovery & solo confidence first; expand after usage data.

## Phase 1 – Core Essentials (Immediate)

Phase 1 Added Weight ≈ 39 lb (rear-biased if stored aft). Track in weight ledger under Recovery. (Delta +3 lb vs 2" insert; justified by reduced play and higher rating.)

## Phase 2 – Capability Expansion (After 3 Field Uses or Identified Need)

| Item                                                     | Spec Target | Est Wt | Est Cost | Trigger to Add           |
|----------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------:|---------:|--------------------------|
| Additional Soft Shackle (x1)                             | Same rating | 0.3 lb |      $40 | Multi-line rigging need  |

## Phase 3 – Winch Integration (Deferred)

Winch selection pending bumper/axle weight gate. Placeholder requirements: 12k–13k synthetic, weight <75 lb incl. line; line speed adequate for cooling cycles. Add fairlead isolator & line protection sleeve.

## Load Tracking Schema (Weight Ledger Fields)

| Field              | Example               | Notes                    |
|--------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------|
| Category           | Recovery              | Primary grouping         |
| Subcategory        | Phase1-Core           | Phase segmentation       |
| Item               | Kinetic Rope 7/8" 30' | Distinguish lengths      |
| Qty                | 1                     | Count                    |
| Individual Wt (lb) | 8.0                   | Verified scale preferred |
| Total Wt (lb)      | 8.0                   | Calc                     |
| Location           | Bed-front bin         | Affects CG               |
| Notes              | MBS 52k               | Include rating           |

## Storage & Organization

- Target: Single low bin forward of rear axle to reduce pitch moment.
- Traction boards: Side mount in canopy (vertical) to keep bed floor clear; log mounting weight separately.
- Moisture: Drill drain grommets in recovery bag bottom (PNW mud).

## Inspection & Maintenance Cadence

| Component       | Interval                      | Action                            |
|-----------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Soft Shackles   | Every use                     | Check glazing, cut fibers         |
| Kinetic Rope    | After muddy event & quarterly | Rinse fresh water, dry fully      |
| Traction Boards | Quarterly                     | Inspect lugs for melt/deformation |
| Tree Saver      | Quarterly                     | Check stitching, UV wear          |

## Risk & Safety Notes

- Never connect kinetic rope to a hitch ball or stamped tie-down loop.
- Maintain recovery exclusion zone = 1.5× rope length (spectators).
- Record each recovery event (conditions, gear used) to justify Phase 2 upgrades.

## Immediate Next Steps

1. Select vendors (bundle discount for rope + shackles + boards).
2. Weigh each item before first field use; enter into `weight-ledger.md`.
3. Add Recovery Inspection checklist to pre-trip doc (future module).

## Open Decisions

| Decision   | Options                             | Criteria                                       | Target Date       |
|------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| Rope brand | **Yankum (Utah)** vs Rhino vs Bubba | **PNW proximity**, True MBS, sheath durability | After price check |

### Kinetic Rope Regional Analysis
- **Yankum Ropes:** Utah-based (closest to PNW) - Known for quality UHMWPE cores, excellent customer service
- **Rhino USA:** Florida-based - Popular but distant 
- **Bubba Rope:** Alabama-based - Good reputation but farthest from PNW

**Recommendation:** **Yankum Ropes** - Utah location supports regional economy, shorter shipping, known quality in western off-road community.

Assumptions: Vehicle curb 7600 lb (refine after scale). Adjust rope diameter if curb + payload > 8800 lb consistently.
