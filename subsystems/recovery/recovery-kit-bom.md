# Recovery Kit BOM (Phase-Structured)

Vehicle Context: 2025 F-250 Tremor (7.3 gas) ~7500–7800 lb curb (assumed), GVWR ~10,800 lb. Tremor has factory front tow hooks (confirm stamped WLL). Rear: 2.5" hitch receiver with 2" reducer sleeve on hand; prefer direct 2.5" recovery hardware to eliminate slop and maximize pin shear margin (use reducer only for 2" accessories when required).

Principles:
- Weight discipline: choose synthetic, modular, multi-use components.
- Ratings: Minimum WLL ~1.5× GVW static for rigging hardware; Kinetic rope MBS 2.5–3× vehicle weight.
- Sequencing: Buy only what unlocks safe self-recovery & solo confidence first; expand after usage data.

Phase 1 Added Weight ≈ 39 lb (rear-biased if stored aft). Track in weight ledger under Recovery. (Delta +3 lb vs 2" insert; justified by reduced play and higher rating.)

## Phase 2 – Capability Expansion (After 3 Field Uses or Identified Need)

|----------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------:|---------:|--------------------------|
| Additional Soft Shackle (x1)                             | Same rating | 0.3 lb |      $40 | Multi-line rigging need  |

## Phase 3 – Winch Integration (Deferred)

Winch selection pending bumper/axle weight gate. Placeholder requirements: 12k–13k synthetic, weight <75 lb incl. line; line speed adequate for cooling cycles. Add fairlead isolator & line protection sleeve.

## Load Tracking Schema (Weight Ledger Fields)

| Field              | Example               | Notes                    |
|--------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------|
| Category           | Recovery              | Primary grouping         |
| Subcategory        | Phase1-Core           | Phase segmentation       |
| Item               | Kinetic Rope 7/8" 30' | Distinguish lengths      |
| Qty                | 1                     | Count                    |
| Individual Wt (lb) | 8.0                   | Verified scale preferred |
| Total Wt (lb)      | 8.0                   | Calc                     |
| Location           | Bed-front bin         | Affects CG               |
| Notes              | MBS 52k               | Include rating           |

## Storage & Organization

- Target: Single low bin forward of rear axle to reduce pitch moment.
- Traction boards: Side mount in canopy (vertical) to keep bed floor clear; log mounting weight separately.
- Moisture: Drill drain grommets in recovery bag bottom (PNW mud).

## Inspection & Maintenance Cadence

| Component       | Interval                      | Action                            |
|-----------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Soft Shackles   | Every use                     | Check glazing, cut fibers         |
| Kinetic Rope    | After muddy event & quarterly | Rinse fresh water, dry fully      |
| Traction Boards | Quarterly                     | Inspect lugs for melt/deformation |
| Tree Saver      | Quarterly                     | Check stitching, UV wear          |

## Risk & Safety Notes

- Never connect kinetic rope to a hitch ball or stamped tie-down loop.
- Maintain recovery exclusion zone = 1.5× rope length (spectators).
- Record each recovery event (conditions, gear used) to justify Phase 2 upgrades.

## Immediate Next Steps

1. Select vendors (bundle discount for rope + shackles + boards).
2. Weigh each item before first field use; enter into `weight-ledger.md`.
3. Add Recovery Inspection checklist to pre-trip doc (future module).

## Open Decisions

| Decision    | Options                      | Criteria                       | Target Date       |
|-------------|------------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------|
| Rope brand  | Yankum vs Rhino vs Bubba     | True MBS, sheath durability    | After price check |
| Board brand | Maxtrax MkII vs ARB TRED Pro | Cold impact strength, lug life | Prior to purchase |

Assumptions: Vehicle curb 7600 lb (refine after scale). Adjust rope diameter if curb + payload > 8800 lb consistently.
