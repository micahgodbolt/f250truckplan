# Gates & Triggers Detail

Expanded criteria supporting decisions summarized in the main build plan.

## Suspension & Ride

### Rear Sag / Spring Upgrade Gate

- Measure hub→fender (rear) unladen baseline.
- With camper + typical gear (no trailer):
  - <1.0" sag: stock leaf acceptable.
  - 1.0–1.5": monitor as load stabilizes.
  - >1.5": evaluate progressive leaf pack.
- With camper + gear + trailer + WDH engaged:
  - Maintain ≥0.5–1.0" rear-high rake (rear higher than front). If <0.5" → consider trim aid (bags) or spring change.

### Carli Backcountry System

Proceed only if BOTH:

1. Rear sag exceeds threshold OR ride quality on washboard rated ≥3/5 severity.
2. Payload stabilized (no major weight adds planned Phase 2–3).

### Air Bag Trim Assist (Deferred)

Activation Criteria (Any):

1. Loaded rake <0.5" (rear not clearly higher) after WDH setup.
2. Need fine trim between multiple trailer loading scenarios.
3. Rear sag acceptable without trailer (<1.25") but towing pushes beyond desired rake.

Non-Criteria: If camper+gear sag alone >1.25–1.5" → address with spring capacity first.

## Tires (37" Evaluation)

Data Needed:

- Baseline towing transmission temps (ambient / sustained / peak on representative grade).
- Scale weights (axle, gross) with operational load.
- Current payload buffer (≥250 lbs after Phase 2 required).

Proceed only if: Temps remain within safe margin (no hunting), torque acceptable, and no gearing complaints under trailer.

## Electrical Expansion

Add second 150Ah battery only if sustained average daily DoD >30% across ≥5 trips OR supporting extended stationary RV power >2 days with high-draw appliances.

24V migration triggers: Induction cooktop, continuous >3 kW loads, or repeated inverter thermal limiting.

## Armor

Add additional plates only upon:

- Documented strikes OR
- Trail profile shift (≥30% rocky / ledge travel) OR
- Exposure assessment identifies catastrophic vulnerability with high probability.

## Lighting

Stage only when a documented gap appears:

1. Reverse/work (safety) → implement early.
2. Scene/area: after night camp setup friction observed.
3. Forward ditch/driving: after repeated dark trail speed control issues.
4. Roof bar: only if high-speed night desert / open terrain becomes common (defer otherwise).

## Weight Optimization Trigger

Initiate Phase 7 early if payload buffer <200 lbs or front/rear axle approaches ≥90% GAWR on scale.

## Towing / WDH

Re-adjust WDH if:

- Front axle weight after bar tension differs >100 lbs from unhitched baseline.
- Headlight aim or steering feel changes after suspension modifications.

## Onboard Air Tank Addition

Only if: Frequent air tool use, bead seating events, or pressure stability requirement emerges. Otherwise remain tankless for weight.
