# Overland Build Context & Background (Reference)

This file preserves background rationale and guidance removed from the streamlined action-focused build plan.

## A. Collaboration Guidance

Provide iterative prompts like:

- "Refine suspension phase with focus on mixed highway + washboard minimizing payload sag (planned payload X lbs)."
- "Add a budget column with low / mid / premium options for power system."
- "Compare aluminum vs steel front bumper choices by weight, winch compatibility, cost, lead time."

Specify: Section + Focus + Constraints (budget, weight, timeline, region, climate, existing parts).

## B. Build Philosophy

- Reliable > flashy.
- Weight discipline early; every added pound must justify itself.
- Serviceable in remote areas (common parts, simplified systems).
- Modularity: vehicle can revert to work/utility role.
- Safety & recovery before luxury.
- Electrical redundancy for critical systems.
- Progressive phased implementation with validation gates.

## C. Environment & Usage Context

- Regions: Coastal PNW moisture (corrosion risk), Cascades snow & cold starts, Central/Eastern WA/OR high desert dust & heat, MT/ID elevation and mixed surfaces.
- Ambient range: 0°F to 100°F expected.
- Current travel profile: Mostly solo, future convoy interest.
- Mixed mission: Overland weekends, 5–10 day exploratory trips, towing RV for stationary base-camp stays.

## D. Assumptions Captured

| Area | Assumption | Validation Action |
|------|------------|------------------|
| Axle Ratio | 4.30 with 7.3 Tremor | Confirm door sticker axle code |
| Rear Locker | Factory e-locker present | Confirm window sticker / engage test |
| Camper Weight | Super Pacific 325–360 lbs | Obtain manufacturer spec / scale after install |
| Tongue Weight | ~800 lbs (WDH use) | Scale with trailer loaded for trip |
| Tire Size | 35" retained Year 1 | Re-evaluate post weight audit |
| Constant Rear Load Threshold | >600–700 lbs triggers spring change | Measure sag after loading |

## E. Decision Framework (Reference)

| Domain | Primary Metric | Secondary Metric |
|--------|----------------|------------------|
| Tires | Load capacity & traction | Rolling resistance, noise |
| Suspension | Control & support | Serviceability, rebuild interval |
| Electrical | Runtime vs loads | Weight per usable Ah, modularity |
| Recovery | Rated capacity & usability | Weight, storage footprint |
| Storage | Access speed & security | Config flexibility |
| Armor | Coverage vs risk | Weight per protected component |

## F. Rationale Notes (Abbrev.)

- 35" tires kept initially to preserve towing performance with 4.30.
- Progressive leaf vs airbags: preserve articulation & ride; airbags only for trim.
- Portable / modular solar favored for shaded PNW forests.
- Drawer delay: avoids committing weight before confirming gear patterns.

## G. Future Modules (Optional)

- Weight ledger template
- RV power load worksheet
- Suspension decision gate form
- Recovery kit specification matrix
- Pre-trip inspection checklist
