Procedure Reference:

1. Weigh unhitched (front / rear) with trailer nearby (optional pre-step).
2. Hitch trailer (no bars) and scale (front / rear / trailer axles).
3. Engage bars to target setting and scale again.
4. Front axle after bars should return to within ~50â€“100 lbs of unhitched baseline.
5. Record link count / tension; replicate for future setups.
