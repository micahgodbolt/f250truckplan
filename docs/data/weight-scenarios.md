# Weight Management & Scenarios

Moved from main build plan to isolate evolving numeric assumptions.

## Component Weight Table (Planned Adds)

| Front bumper + winch                   | 170–205          | Aluminum hybrid target               |
| Skid & steering protection             | 70–110           | Selective plates only                |
| Rear bumper (no swing-out)             | 90–120           | May retain OEM + hidden points       |
| Drawer/modular storage                 | 80–150           | Delay permanent drawers              |
| Fridge (50L) + mount                   | 55–70            | Slide delete to save weight          |
| Aux battery 150Ah LiFePO4              | 38–45            | Core pack                            |
| Secondary expansion battery            | 25–35            | Only if extended base-camp need      |
| Inverter (2–3 kW) + cabling            | 35–55            | 12V inverter-charger selected        |
| Roof rack + lights minimal             | 40–70            | Camper track first                   |
| Water (10–15 gal)                      | 83–125           | Modular containers                   |
| Recovery gear full kit                 | 60–90            | Distributed low & central            |
| Air system (twin compressor + no tank) | 25–40            | Tank optional                        |

## Payload Planning Note

Tongue (~850 plan) + camper (390) + front protection (~190) + WDH (~100) ≈ 1,530 lbs before people, fluids variance, water, gear. Maintain ≥150 lb buffer.

## Projected Running Weight Scenario (Midpoint)

| Tongue Weight               | 850           | Planning value                          |

| TOTAL                       | 2,703         | Buffer ≈397 lbs to 3,100                |

Buffer Policy: Reserve ≥150 lbs. If payload margin <200 lbs post-scale → initiate optimization (lighter components, remove redundancies).

## Future Weight Optimization Candidates

- Replace steel hardware with aluminum/stainless where safe.
- Drawer avoidance if bins remain effective.
- Lighter winch option (short synthetic line) if front axle load approaches FGAWR.
